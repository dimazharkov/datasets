# Datasets

This directory contains **publicly available datasets** that are used in my research activities and experiments.  
The datasets are collected, processed, and documented to support various tasks in the fields of **machine learning, natural language processing, and data analysis**.

## Purpose

- To provide a transparent and reproducible foundation for experiments.  
- To share datasets that can be reused for related research or benchmarking.  
- To maintain structured and well-documented data sources for ongoing projects.  

## Notes

- All datasets stored here are either openly available or derived from public sources.  
- Each dataset has its own subdirectory with a dedicated `README.md` file that describes its structure, purpose, and usage.  
- Some datasets may include additional processed fields (e.g., summaries, vector representations) created for experimental needs.  

## Usage

You are free to explore the datasets for educational and research purposes.  
If you use them in your work, please provide proper attribution where applicable.
